{"name":"upolicy","body":"* upolicy - Sandboxing with policy decisions in userspace\r\n\r\n** Introduction\r\n\r\nupolicy allows unprivileged userspace processes to control access\r\nto their child processes system resources. This all is done in a \r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use][TOCTTOU]] safe \r\nway, by making use of the Linux Security Module API.\r\n\r\nupolicy is actually comprised of two pieces of software:\r\n\r\n- a kernel module, which plugs into the LSM API and\r\n- a userspace library\r\n\r\nThese two pieces communicate by the means of a generic netlink socket. The\r\nuserspace library provides an abstraction of the actual kernel interface,\r\nmaking it quite easy to use (see [[http://github.com/speijnik/upolicy/examples/][Examples directory]]).\r\n\r\nAs of the time of this writing the code which can be found here should be\r\nconsidered as an early technology preview. \r\nIt will contain some rough edges at some places and the API must NOT be\r\nconsidered stable and is subject to change at any time.\r\n\r\nupolicy is not yet intended to be used in production environments. \r\nYou have been warned.\r\n\r\n** Installing\r\n\r\n*** Requirements\r\n\r\n- kernel with LSMStub patch (see below)\r\n- libnl >= 3.2 (specifically also the genl part)\r\n- automake, autoconf, libtool and friends (for building)\r\n- Python >= 2.7, < 3.0 for building the Python bindings\r\n- Doxygen for building the library documentation\r\n- Perl for building the kernel documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Requirements (Ubuntu 12.04)\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu 12.04 the following packages should do:\r\n\r\napt-get install build-essential libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev python-all-dev automake autoconf libtool perl\r\n\r\nAdditionally the LSMStub PPA is required:\r\napt-add-repository ppa:speijnik/lsmstub-kernel\r\n\r\n*** LSMStub kernel\r\nIn upolicy's early development stage it is favorable to be able to load and\r\nunload the module at will. Unfortunately, this is not possible with the LSM\r\nAPI per-se, because it is not exported to loadable kernel modules.\r\nIn short: upolicy requires a patched kernel, which implements the LSMStub\r\nAPI. Such kernels can be either found in code-form at [[https://github.com/speijnik/linux/tree/ubuntu_precise][github.com/speijnik/linux/]] or pre-compiled\r\nfor Ubuntu 12.04 at [[https://launchpad.net/~speijnik/+archive/lsmstub-kernel][launchpad: LSMStub enabled kernels PPA]].\r\nBe warned that AppArmor is not enabled by default in the pre-built kernels, so do not use them on production systems.\r\n\r\n** Documentation\r\n\r\nThe upolicy documentation can be found at [[http://speijnik.github.com/upolicy/doc]].\r\n","tagline":"Userspace security policies","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
